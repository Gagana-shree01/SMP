A ML model that predicts student marks using regression
One well-known data science case study that uses regression as its foundation is the prediction of student marks.
Provided certain details on the students, such as:
1.The quantity of courses they have chosen 
2.The average amount of time they spend studying each day
3.Grades attained by students
Estimation is done on other students grades using this information.
The dataset I have used for the student marks prediction task is downloaded from Kaggle.
Because it is simple to comprehend and answer, this regression issue is a suitable choice for those new to data science.
